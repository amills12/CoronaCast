    - #### `App.js` - This is what renders all of our browser routes and different views
    - #### `index.js` - This is what renders the react app by rendering App.js, should not change
- #### `package.json` - Defines npm behaviors and packages for the client
#### `server` - Holds the server application
- #### `config` - This holds our configuration files, like mongoDB uri
- #### `controllers` - These hold all of the callback functions that each route will call
- #### `models` - This holds all of our data models
- #### `routes` - This holds all of our HTTP to URL path associations for each unique url

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run-script dev`

Runs both the client app and the server app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.

### `npm run-script client`

Runs just the client app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.


### `npm run-script server`

Runs just the server in development mode.<br>


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

If deploying to heroku this does not need to be run since it is handled by the heroku-postbuild script<br>

## CoronaCast
CoronaCast is a web application for seeing daily case and death statistics along with a statistical analysis for any county in the United States. CoronaCast uses various apis on both the client and server sides of the application to handle requests, the database, and storage of user credentials. The application features an easy-to-use interface for signing up, changing settings, as well as accessing web-page reports. Users can further opt-in and opt-out of receiving emails of CoronaCast statistics for the county of their choice. The application also features an admin page for developers to view CoronaCast users, edit their saved user information, and remove users.
